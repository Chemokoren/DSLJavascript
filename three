Infinite String
 Coding
Description
Problem Statement
In this problem you will be given a string S , consisting of lowercase alphabets (a-z), in which each character is unique. Another string INF is formed by repeating the string S infinitely many times.

Example: If S = “abcde” then the string INF is …abcdeabcdeabcde… Here the dots (’.’) indicate that there are infinitely many characters before and after the string.

Now you will be given another string A and asked to find whether there is any sub-string in INF which is identical to A.

Input Format
The first line contains the number of test-cases T.
The next T lines will contain a space-separated string, made up of two parameters:
The first parameter will be infStr, representing S from the above example
The second parameter will be toFind, representing A from the above example.
Output Format
The function should print YES if A can be found in S, otherwise it should print NO.
e.g., If the second line of input contains:

abcd abce
The function should print NO, because, if we repeat “abcd” infinitely many times we will get, “…abcdabcdabcdabcd…” . We will never get an “e”.
Evaluation Parameters
Sample Input
ghijk ghijkghi
Sample Output
YES
Explanation
The infinite string of 'ghijk' contains 'ghijkghi' as it's sub-string, hence you print YES.
